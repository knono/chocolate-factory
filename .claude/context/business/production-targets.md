## Improvement Initiatives

### Short-term (3 months)
1. Reduce changeover time by 20%
2. Implement predictive scheduling based on REE prices
3. Optimize batch sequencing to minimize idle time

### Medium-term (6 months)
1. Achieve 75% OEE target
2. Reduce energy consumption to 2.2 kWh/kg
3. Implement full traceability system

### Long-term (12 months)
1. Reach 2.0 kWh/kg energy target
2. Expand premium line to 40% of production
3. Achieve zero unplanned downtime days

## Constraints and Considerations

### Production Limitations
- Single conche bottleneck limits daily batches
- Temperature control critical in summer months
- Humidity must remain < 60% for quality

### Market Considerations
- Peak demand: November-December (holidays)
- Low demand: July-August (summer heat)
- Weekly pattern: Higher sales Friday-Sunday

### Resource Optimization
- Schedule energy-intensive processes during valley hours
- Balance workforce across shifts
- Maintain 5% safety stock for demand spikes
